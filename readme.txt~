This is a proyect for the subject: "Introducción a la robótica inteligente" (IRIN). This subject was divided in two parts and this is the proyect for the first part.
In this proyect we had to create a robot with a behavioral based architecture. 

We decided to do a robot that would catch the yellow lights and avoid the red ones. The blue light is like a battery charger so when the robot has low battery it has to go charge. The black areas are like montains so the slow the robot. When the robot has captured all the yellow lights it has to go back to it's original place thanks to a map he has created will he was catching the lights. All of this has an history that can be found on the report (only in spanish).

If you want to try this software you can find the instructions on the manual of how to use IRSIM simulator.
Here is a link to the web where you will find the simulator: http://www.robolabo.etsit.upm.es/subjects.php?subj=irin&tab=tab3
